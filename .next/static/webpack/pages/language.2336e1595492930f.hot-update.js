Getting a sense for how the various parts of speech interact, how verbs or nouns transform in different contexts, etc. etc. makes your inevitable grammar study that will come later a whole lot easier.

We then need to correct any falsely internalized information we may have assumed early on to move forward, and these stops and starts can be frustrating and disorienting. I think this is inevitable in language learning, but a big skim of something like the language grammar page on Wikipedia before you dive into your studies can really help ameliorate some of these mini pitfalls.

We don't even really learn languages by speaking them. By far the most effective way to learn a language is to listen to it and understand it. If you don't really understand what I mean by this, try searching your target language name with \\\"comprehensible input beginner from zero\\\" on YouTube and watching some of what comes up. You will find that even without any knowledge of the language, with enough context and visual aid, there are indeed ways to make sense of what is otherwise gibberish into something comprehensible. Live in this stuff. Breathe it. Fill your phone up with podcasts.
