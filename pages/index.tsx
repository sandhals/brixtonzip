          Hi, I'm Brixton! I was born in Canada, relocated to the Japanese countryside in 2016, and since 2021 have been living in Korea. I spend most of my free time learning languages, working out, building websites, reading, writing, and <a href="sketchbook">sketching</a>. Welcome to my online zip folder.

          <span className="pill opener">SOCIALS</span>
          I mostly lurk (but occasionally tweet) at <a href="http://twitter.com/brixton">@brixton</a> on Twitter, I ‚Äúpost physique‚Äù at <a href="http://instagram.com/ydalir">@ydalir</a> on Insta, and I collect images, <a href="http://are.na/brixton/alexandria">PDFs</a>, and other digital bric-a-brac on <a href="http://are.na/brixton">Are.na</a>. I am also <a href="https://network.urbit.org/~sattex-ballet">~sattex-ballet</a> on Urbit.

        {/* LANGUAGE */}
        <p className="hometext">
          <span className="pill opener">LANGUAGE</span>
          Most of my life circles around language. I write for a living, study its history and structure for fun, and <a href="language">learn new ones</a> when I have the time. In another life, I went to grad school to pursue Modernist literature studies and specialized in the life and work of Virginia Woolf. In this timeline, I found a career in copywriting. My two strongest foreign languages are Japanese and Korean, and most of the serious linguistics reading I do is on <a href="https://www.are.na/brixton/japanese-korean-hypothesis">their contested relationship</a> with each other. Recently, I've started <a href="files/chinese-anki.pdf">dabbling</a> in Chinese, and can speak a bit of French and Norwegian too.

              Sun's out, guns out. I recently weighed in at the heaviest I've ever been (in a good way) and am ready to start cutting for spring and summer! Slowly making more time for reading. Getting progressively more addicted to Substack. Trying to sleep better. All that good stuff.
